# Text-Analytics-with-Congressional-Speeches
I use various techniques for analyzing the Stanford Congressional Records.  

Data: Congressional Record text documents, mainly from Stanford's repository which you can find here: https://exhibits.stanford.edu/data/catalog/md374tz9962

First I show how to build useful data structures from text documents such as:
-Corpus
-Document Frequency Matrix(DFM)
-Dataframes
-Keyword-In-Context(KWIC) Windows

Next I go over text analytic techniques such as: 
-Sentiment Analysis
-Lexical Diversity
-Readability
-TF-IDF
-Topic Modeling
-More!
